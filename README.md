# ZipCaptions

## Free Speech-To-Text In Your Browser
Zip Captions is a platform that allows users to generate text from a given audio source, using only your web browser.

## Language Support
We currently support multiple languages, by navigating to the `Settings` page. Would you like to see a language added that is not yet available?
We encourage users to generate a translation file by referencing the source file at `packages/client/src/assets/i18n/en.json`. If you then create 
a matching output file for your language, we can implement support more easily.
